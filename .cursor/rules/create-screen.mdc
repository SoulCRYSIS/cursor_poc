This project is Flutter 3.32.2
You will be giving a figma link to a screen frame.
I want it to be exactly like in the figma including pixel perfect.
Use components in lib/components to create a screen and add a button navigate to it in [main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart)
Just leave the call API part for now.
