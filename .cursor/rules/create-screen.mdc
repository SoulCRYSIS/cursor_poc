This project is Flutter 3.32.2
You will be giving a figma link to a frame.
Use components in lib/components if possible.
I want it to be exactly like in the figma including pixel perfect.
Create a screen from it and add a button to it in [main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart)
Just leave the call API part for now.
