This project is Flutter 3.32.2
You will be giving a figma link to a frame.
Use components in lib/components if possible.
Header with star icon is just functionality name for grouping, real screens are inside it.
Create screens from it and add a button to it in [main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart)
Just leave the logic part for now.
